<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>A new class of drugs holds the promise to control multidrug-resistant malaria causing microbes. A report of a joint team of collaborators from USA, Switzerland, Singapore and Thailand.<br/>Abstract:<br/>Recent reports of increased tolerance to artemisinin derivatives—the most recently adopted class of antimalarials—have prompted a need for new treatments. The spirotetrahydro-β-carbolines, or spiroindolones, are potent drugs that kill the blood stages of <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em> and <em>Plasmodium vivax</em> clinical isolates at low nanomolar concentration. Spiroindolones rapidly inhibit protein synthesis in <em>P. falciparum</em>, an effect that is ablated in parasites bearing nonsynonymous mutations in the gene encoding the P-type cation-transporter ATPase4 (PfATP4). The optimized spiroindolone NITD609 shows pharmacokinetic properties compatible with once-daily oral<br/> dosing and has single-dose efficacy in a rodent malaria model.<br/>                     <br/>Complete <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5996/1175.full'>here</a>.<br/></div>

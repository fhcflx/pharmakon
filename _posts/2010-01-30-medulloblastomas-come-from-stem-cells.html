<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>A recent report published in <a href='http://www.nature.com/onc/journal/v29/n12/abs/onc2009472a.html' target='_blank'>Oncogene</a> has shed new light to the origin on medulloblastomas, linking them to neural stem cells. Cells with stem cell properties have been isolated from various areas of<br /> the postnatal mammalian brain, most recently from the postnatal mouse <br />cerebellum. A team from Switzerland and UK has showed that inactivation of the tumor suppressor genes<br /> <i>Rb</i> and <i>p53</i> in these endogenous neural stem cells induced deregulated proliferation and resistance to apoptosis <i>in vitro.</i><br /> Moreover, they have injected these cells into mice, forming medulloblastomas. <br />Medulloblastomas are the most common malignant brain tumors of <br />childhood, and despite recent advances in treatment they are associated <br />with high morbidity and mortality. They are highly heterogeneous tumors <br />characterized by a diverse genetic make-up and expression profile as <br />well as variable prognosis. The authors described a novel ontogenetic <br />pathway of medulloblastoma that significantly contributes to <br />understanding their heterogeneity. Experimental medulloblastomas <br />originating from neural stem cells preferentially expressed stem cell <br />markers Nestin, Sox2 and Sox9, which were not expressed in <br />medulloblastomas originating from granule-cell-restricted progenitors. <br />Furthermore, the expression of these markers identified a subset of <br />human medulloblastomas associated with a poorer clinical outcome.<br/><br/></div>

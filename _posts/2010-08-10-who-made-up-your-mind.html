<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>A Harvard team has disclosed differences in paternal/maternal influence on gene profile expression in the brain.<br/>Abstract: <br/>Genomic imprinting results in preferential gene expression from paternally versus maternally inherited chromosomes. We used a genome-wide approach to uncover sex-specific parent-of-origin allelic effects in the adult mouse brain. Our study identified preferential selection of the maternally inherited X chromosome in glutamatergic neurons of the female cortex. Moreover, analysis of the cortex and hypothalamus identified 347 autosomal genes with sex-specific imprinting features. In the hypothalamus, sex-specific imprinted genes were mostly found in females, which suggests parental influence over the hypothalamic function of daughters. We show that <em>interleukin-18</em>, a gene linked to diseases with sex-specific prevalence, is subject to complex, regional, and sex-specific parental effects in the brain. Parent-of-origin effects thus provide new avenues for investigation of sexual dimorphism in brain function and disease.<br/>Complete <a target='_blank' href='http://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5992/682.full'>here</a>.<br/></div>

A set of reviews about the role of oxidative stress-related injury in the genesis of cardiovascular disease are some of the most popular recently published papers in the American Journal of the Medical Sciences. They are the transcription of lectures presented in a <a href="http://bit.ly/qqJmTC">symposium</a> held as part of the annual scientific session of the Southern Society for Clinical Investigation. Internationally recognized experts spoke about the role of oxidative damage in myocardial remodeling in chronic mitral regurgitation (Gladden et al), heart failure (Sawyer DB), myocardial infarction (Robinson et al), atherosclerosis (Mitra et al), and other relevant topics.<br /><br />Oxidative stress has been recognized as an important cornerstone in the development of these and other cardiovascular diseases, and anti-oxidante drugs have the potential to help decrease cardiovascular risk. When a prooxidant stimulus is persistent and excessive,  natural endogenous anti-oxidant defenses are ultimately overwhelmed and unable to cope. Consequently, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (free radicals) overproduction account for deleterious cellular responses, including  cardiomyocyte apoptosis and necrosis.<br /><br />One of the most well-known associations between oxidative stress and cardiac disease is in the genesis of atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence that links oxidized-LDL with oxidative stress includes its  elevated serum concentrations in patients having ischemic heart disease,  especially in those having the greatest elevation in ox-LDL found with  the acute coronary syndrome. These and many other evidence are reviewed in the articles, follow the links bellow:<br /><br /><strong>Gladden JD, et al.</strong> Oxidative stress and myocardial remodeling in chronic mitral regurgitation.

    Atenção aos aficionados por produtos naturais e aos que desacreditam deles: consumir a partir de 500mg de ácidos graxos ômega
    3 na dieta ou suplementos reduz a incidência de câncer de próstata e de câncer de próstata avançado. Foi o que um estudo
    publicado numa das mais prestigiadas revistas de cancerologia do mundo concluiu. A notícia completa segue abaixo:

    NEW YORK (Reuters Health) Mar 25 - Results of a case-control study suggest that a high intake of long-chain omega-3
    fatty acids protects against advanced prostate cancer, and this effect may be modified by a genetic variant of COX-2,
    a key enzyme in fatty acid metabolism and inflammation.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Previous research has shown protection (by omega-3 fatty acids) against prostate cancer, but this is one of the first
    studies to show protection against advanced prostate cancer and interaction with COX-2," Dr. John S. Witte of the University
    of California, San Francisco noted in a statement from the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR)
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. Witte and colleagues studied 466 men diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer and 478 age- and ethnicity-matched
    controls. They assessed diet using a food frequency questionnaire and genotyped the men for nine COX-2 single nucleotide
    polymorphisms.
  </p>
  <p>
    In an online issue of the AACR journal Clinical Cancer Research, the researchers report that increasing intake of long-chain
    omega-3 fatty acids was strongly associated with a decreased risk of aggressive prostate cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Men in the highest quartiles of long chain omega-3 fatty acid intake had a 63 percent reduced risk of aggressive prostate
    cancer (odds ratio, 0.37) compared to men in the lowest quartile.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Importantly," Dr. Witte and colleagues say, this protective effect was even stronger in men who carried the COX-2 single
    nucleotide polymorphism rs4647310, a risk factor for prostate cancer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, men with low intake of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids and this particular variant had a more than fivefold
    increased risk of advanced prostate cancer (odds ratio, 5.49), whereas men with high intake of omega-3 fatty acids had a
    substantially reduced risk, even if they carried the COX-2 rs4647310 variant.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, the increased risk of prostate cancer associated with the COX-2 rs4647310 variant was "essentially reversed
    by increasing omega-3 fatty acid intake by a half a gram per day," Dr. Witte said.
  </p>
  <p>
    "If you want to think of the overall inverse association in terms of fish, where omega-3 fatty acids are commonly derived,
    the strongest effect was seen from eating dark fish such as salmon one or more times per week," he added.
